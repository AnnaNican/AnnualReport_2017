# Quantified Self 2017

Visual one-page summary of how I have spend my 2017. 

## Rationale

Countless experiments and research has shown that our (human) self-awareness is fictitious. We tend to overestimate our abilities and to embellish our achievements. For self-sanity check I try to track my life. I have selected the tracking methods that require minimum effort, while still report on my general levels of development. 

## Data:

Data for the project was tracked with the following:

* ResqueTime - for productivity
* Goodreads.com - for reading
* Foursquare - for location
* Suunto - for training
* Github/Bitbucket - for productivity
